Hi Jason,



I want to create UDP application to control the hardware. There are any 3 component for communication.
1. Bind IP address and port
2. Receiver port
3. Send port



If you interest with my project, feel free to contact me.



Thanks
Sigit

Hi Jason. You have a new custom request from Sigit.
Please review and respond by June 16, 2023.
Once you’ve agreed to the deliverables, timeline, and pricing, you can send a proposed contract for Sigit’s approval.
Learn about proposed contracts

Jason Alava 12:12 PM
Hello, Thanks for contacting me

Yes, no problem~!!

Do you have the protocol document of your hardware?

SS
Sigit Susanto 12:31 PM
Thanks for reply.



Actualy i have 2 hardware.
1. I have protocol and command document
2. I dont have document but i know the command protocol

Jason Alava 1:33 PM
I see

Jason Alava 1:40 PM
I have questions
- Do you want to control hardware in local area network?

Jason Alava 1:58 PM
- Probably, you wanna do remote control on public network?
- What language do you prefer?
- Please provide me the protocols for each device

Programming language*

SS
Sigit Susanto 7:17 PM
No, remote on Local Network.
Maybe use Visual Studio or Visual basic is ok. The UDP protocol contain command send and receiver response from the hardware.



Attached protocol document, and actually i have sample program from the origin programer but i dont know the source code.

Jason Alava 8:41 PM
Ok, I will use C# for this development. Seems like there are many protocols needs to be implemented for communication

How much is the budget for each device protocol implementation?

I will not start from the original source code. just need to simply take a look at port number and device ip address from the original code.

SS
Sigit Susanto 8:51 PM
Okay,
The budget approx 350USD. Is okay about the budget?
I have .exe portable application. If you need it then i can send to you. Maybe you can do reverse engineering

Jason Alava 9:47 PM
To complete this project, I require a budget of over $1,000. Since I am located in the United States, I will not have any tax-free options for payment.

SS
Sigit Susanto 11:25 PM
Okay lets start with $1,000.
How long estimated you build the new software?

Wed, Jun 14
Jason Alava 2:56 AM
I need one week. for implementation and and also thorough test and will deliver the result in time

SS
Sigit Susanto 3:27 AM
okay, if you want to see the software from previous programer lets me know, then i will send to you

Jason Alava 3:35 AM
Ok, you can send it to me for the reference

So do I create contract?

Can you send me the the application file again after chaning extension? Virus dected, so it cannot be downloaded

Jason Alava 7:27 AM
I sent you contract proposal. Kindly check

Jason Alava 11:44 AM
Hi Sigit Susanto

Sigit Susanto 9:12 PM
Hi Jason,
The application is portable .exe. and i archive with winzip. Are you receiver the application and video?

Jason Alava 9:58 PM
Hi Sigit, Yes I know it is C# winform

Yes, I received the video

Just i wanted to check the code to see the udp port and protocols

what original developer used

Can you send me app file as another zip format and send me?

it shows virus warning

Jason Alava 10:09 PM
when i click the application.zip. it shows this warning, so i am asking you to send the zip in another file format

Hi Jason,



I already receive the contract quotation. What is the new application is similiar with the origin software or other. Kindly please help describe more details.



Thanks and regards

Jason Alava 12:11 PM
Hi Sigit.
New application should be tidy and clean UI with optimized network protocols. I will use C# winform like previous one.

Jason Alava 12:18 PM
Regarding the app you sent me, I have observed that there is an issue where the user interface freezes or becomes unresponsive when the user clicks a button. This indicates that the previous developer wrote the code directly on the UI main thread instead of using multi-threading techniques.
Don't worry. I will make the new app with highly optimized and non-blocking program.

SS
Sigit Susanto 12:28 PM
Hi Jason,



Thanks for explanation. So the scope delivery is new app and source code C# winform? Right?



How about term of payment?



Thanks

Jason Alava 12:29 PM
1K and one week

Right, new app is C# winform based.

I will follow SDLC and so thorough test before the delivery

do*

SS
Sigit Susanto 12:35 PM
Okay Jason.



Reconfirm the scope delivery is new app C# and source code?



If this first project success then i will sent to you other application need to rebuild also.

Jason Alava 1:09 PM
Sure! New app (C# Winform) with source code delivery for 1K regarding the application just in the video

That's wonderful!

SS
Sigit Susanto 7:35 PM
Hi Jason,



Okay Jason,
Kindly please insert "New app (C# Winform) with source code delivery regarding the application just in the video" on the contract description.



And the payment with downpayment or other other scheme?

Jason Alava 10:38 PM
Hi Sigit Susanto I don't need any upfront.
Just I only need payment on project completion
Let me fix the desc.

I sent new contract proposal. Kindly check and accept if you want to work with me. Thanks

Notes. So what should i do now? I already transfer 500$ to upwork account yesterday

Jason Alava 6:42 AM
Don't worry. it will be pending until you release

Jason Alava 9:07 PM
Hi Sigit,



I have one question. Could you please provide me cons about original program? What is the main issue?

SS
Sigit Susanto 9:26 PM
Hi Jason,



Morning,
Application .exe which i send to you is original program. The issue is when i click Sweep 4G and sweep 2G, then the result not appears in the data grid box. Sweep is sniffer function to start sniffer and show the result to the data grid.



I have another program .exe indicated the sweep 2G and 4G working properly.
If you need this i can share to you. This is C form also.

Hi Sigit,
I've decompiled original program and currently migrating code now. I am seeing that original one has lots of errors, so I am managing the code strictly and at the same time, I am fixing errors. After migration done, I will ask you test new program on your local area network remotely. However, Now, I am thinking that I need some more time for the development.
Regards

Can you give me some more time? Approximately, I need 5 days more. So I think, I can give you the perfect result by end of this month. How do you think about it?

SS
Sigit Susanto 8:41 PM
Hi Jason,

Sure No problem, we can extend the time schedule to better result

Jason Alava 10:23 PM
Thank you, actually original code is so nasty that I cannot use, So i am creating it from the scratch. Yeah. I will do my best for the project completion

Thu, Jun 29
Jason Alava 6:35 AM
Hi Sigit,



I have finished writing the code. Could you please share the remote machine with me so that I can test it? Using AnyDesk should work fine.

Thanks for the remote session. But I noticed there is no 4G device available in this session still

And if I can install VS in this remote session for debugging, it will be great

SS
Sigit Susanto 10:47 PM
Sure, You can install VS in remote laptop

Jason Alava 10:48 PM
Thanks, could you please check 4G devices ? I cannot ping

Perfect! I can see now

It works better than I expected, I need more time to test functions or sometimes I will need to debug. Anyway, Thanks for sharing convenient test env.

I do short test the software with remote, the LTE still not stabel and i cannot get IMSI from LTE data grid. Kindly is possible to fixed it? and other is about sweep 2G and sweep 4G the result still not appears. Kindly is possible to fixed it?

Jason Alava 9:13 AM
Original one works on current remote for LTE?

Current remote is strange now. At the first time, sweep 4G worked well. But not now. Probably, there maybe another issue

SS
Sigit Susanto 9:17 AM
Yes. The Original software works on LTE, we can get IMSI in LTE. The problem is Sweep 2G and Sweep 4G not appears the result

Jason Alava 9:17 AM
Ok. got it. Don't worry. I will handle that issue

SS
Sigit Susanto 9:19 AM
This is the problem, but when i use another program, the sweep 2G and 4G is working

The device still up, i can remote just now for try new release software that you give me above

i think screen saver sleep mode, but today i already to change never sleep for screen and processor

Jason Alava 9:24 AM
Thank you

Sorry, can you show me original 4G_SMS program working? I can see on Anydesk

Can you please do that now?

Just I wanna see you can get IMSI in LTE

SS
Sigit Susanto Tuesday 9:17 AM
Yes. The Original software works on LTE, we can get IMSI in LTE. The problem is Sweep 2G and Sweep 4G not appears the result

Jason Alava 9:35 AM
Does this screenshot show that Sweep 4G works?

Frankly speaking, I am not aware of using the software though which is written by me

Sigit Susanto 9:39 AM
Right side, appear the IMSI for 4G. I think i already sent with the first video

this one

Jason Alava 10:17 AM
By the way, could you please give me the "Another program" that Sweep 2G does work?

In original program, it does only send "AT+CNETSCAN" command when clicking Sweep 2G and then nothing else after that. Probably he did not implement it.

Jason Alava 10:31 AM
Are those buttons for Sweep 2G ?

Sigit Susanto 10:36 AM
This program working at IP address 192.168.178.45. You can change the LAN ethernet with 192.168.178.45 then this program will works and appears result

Jason Alava Tuesday 10:31 AM
Are those buttons for Sweep 2G ?

Sweep 2G to start sniffer GSM. To get GSM signal from surround environment

Sigit Susanto 6:42 AM
Hi Jason, If bit difficult to resolve SWEEP menu, maybe we can skip first and go to second problem regarding 4G Status

4G status disconect, then connected then when the configuration complete then status is closed. Then wen i press SMS, SEND then i will get IMSI and appears and the right data grid

Jason Alava 7:07 AM
Hi Sigit. it seems like that I misunderstood something.



Do you mean that right side appearance of IMSI for 4G is incorrect? Yeah I saw it in the video.

SS
Sigit Susanto Tuesday 9:39 AM
Right side, appear the IMSI for 4G. I think i already sent with the first video

SS
Sigit Susanto 7:12 AM
Hi Jason, yes. i mean right side will showing 4G imsi when i click SEND SMS then i can see the imsi in GSM will showing at the GSM data grid, and IMSI 4G will show in the right side. like at the video

Jason Alava Wednesday 7:07 AM
Hi Sigit. it seems like that I misunderstood something.



Do you mean that right side appearance of IMSI for 4G is incorrect? Yeah I saw it in the video.

Jason Alava 7:13 AM
And regarding the 4G status, the connection status should remain unchanged while there is an active network connection, but current program has status changing all time due to the error, Am I correct?

Lets fix one by one.

SS
Sigit Susanto 7:19 AM
Yes . correct. i found the problem like that reagrding 4G status.

Jason Alava 7:23 AM
How about the status "close"? is that correct status that is automatically changed after "Connected" ?

What is the left side grid for in the window? Can you explain me the difference between left and right side grid?
The original program had a logical error, so I need to clarify a theoretical concept first.

SS
Sigit Susanto 7:36 AM
Status close will appears when the 4G FDD configuration is completed. You can see at the Video at 22 second bar show

at the SMS menu we have SEND. in this case when i click SEND then the Radio will transmit frequency GSM and 4G

then

after radio transmit then the radio will collect all mobile phone surround, we have 5 module. 2 module GSM and 3 module LTE. when the IMSI scanned at module GSM then will show in the left side. when the IMSi scanned in LTE then the IMSI will show at right side

look at the BBU column at the Video

Fri, Jul 07
Jason Alava 4:45 AM
Hi Sigit, we are implementing Heartbeat logic now. Once this function is implemented, the issue will be resolved.
Don't worry. this will be done shortly. I will let you know as soon as we finish implmentation.



Thanks
