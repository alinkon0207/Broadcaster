Hi Jason, If bit difficult to resolve SWEEP menu, maybe we can skip first and go to second problem regarding 4G Status

4G status disconect, then connected then when the configuration complete then status is closed. Then wen i press SMS, SEND then i will get IMSI and appears and the right data grid

Yes . correct. i found the problem like that reagrding 4G status.

Status close will appears when the 4G FDD configuration is completed. You can see at the Video at 22 second bar show

at the SMS menu we have SEND. in this case when i click SEND then the Radio will transmit frequency GSM and 4G
then

after radio transmit then the radio will collect all mobile phone surround, we have 5 module. 2 module GSM and 3 module LTE. when the IMSI scanned at module GSM then will show in the left side. when the IMSi scanned in LTE then the IMSI will show at right side

look at the BBU column at the Video
